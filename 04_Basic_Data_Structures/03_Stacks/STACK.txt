Stack Data Structure: 

1. last in first out [LIFO] / First in last out [FILO]
2. abstract data type 
3. it is Linear Data Structure 
4. first intered value will be stored at the bottom 
5. while removing the top most value will be removed first. 
6. The standard operation on the Stack : 
    - push() - place an item on the stack
    - pop() - return and then remove the top most item in the stack 
    - isEmpty()
    - isFull() 
    - peek() - access the item on ith position 
    - count() - gets the number of items in stack 
    - change() - change the item on ith position
    - display() - display all items in stack

7. Application of Stack : 
    - balancing of Symbols 
    - infix to Postfix / Prefix conversion
    - redo - undo
    - Forward and backward features 
    - Tower of Hanoi, tree traverals,stock span problem, histogram problem
    -  Other applications can be Backtracking, Knight tour problem, rat in a maze, N queen problem and sudoku solver
    - In Graph Algorithms like Topological Sorting and Strongly Connected Components
